    The Yocto Project is not an embedded Linux Distribution,
    it creates a custom one for you. To help you in this customisation,
    Yocto Builder is a tool aimed to ease the use, generation and the deployment
    of Yocto through an intuitive web application.
    Itâ€™s built upon a wide community sharing layers, machines and more in order to reduce effort.
    Create, manage and share your Linux Distribution projects directly on our web application.
